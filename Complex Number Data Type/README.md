## 1.16 Assignment: Complex Number

In this assignment, you will extend the Complex number class that was started in Week 2 of class. For this assignment, you need to implement several member functions and operators:

- Type converter from double to Complex, in which the double becomes the real part of the complex number and the imaginary part remains 0.
- Addition of two complex numbers using operator+
- Subtraction of two complex numbers using operator-
- Unary negation of a complex number using operator-.
- Multiplication of two complex numbers using operator*
- Division of two complex numbers using operator/
- Find the conjugate of a complex number by overloading unary operator~.
- 
Begin with the Complex number from class and extend it to support these operators. Here are the prototypes you should use for these member functions:
